<h3>2. Description of the TYPE of graph.</h3>
<p>The graph is a bar chart with the geom_smooth line showing the trend line.</p>
</div>
<div id="description-of-the-data-you-used" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Description of the DATA you used</h3>
<p>The data refers to the moma dataset. In this graph, the final data frame is f_moma2(final moma). The quantitative variable is the count of number of paintings created.The qualitative variable is the year during which the paintings were created</p>

<div id="description-of-the-audience-you-are-aiming-for" class="section level3">
<h3>4. Description of the AUDIENCE you are aiming for</h3>
<p>The audience over here is someone who wants to see the paintings done by women over the years</p>
</div>
<div id="representation-description" class="section level3">
<h3>5. Representation Description:</h3>
<p>This graph shows the count of number of paintings done by women across the years.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-to-read-it-what-to-look-for" class="section level3">
<h3>6. How to read it &amp; What to look for</h3>
<p>For year-gap on x-axis, read the number of paintings created during that period.</p>
<p><strong>Major Highlights</strong> It seems that Women actually painted more paintings during the year 1960-2000. Also,the highest number of paintings(15) around 1985-1990.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentation-tips" class="section level3">
<h3>7. Presentation tips</h3>
<p>Using scale_x_continuous and scale_y_continuous, the padding at the starting and ending of the x-axis has been removed. The color scheme used is in relation to the artist-gender(female). The trend line has been added to get the sense of overall increase/decrease using geom_smooth</p>
</div>
<div id="variations-and-alternatives" class="section level3">
<h3>8. Variations and alternatives</h3>
<p>This plot can be improved by including the Male gender to see how the Female’s performed wrt Male artists.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-i-created-it" class="section level3">
<h3>9. How I created it</h3>
<p>I formulated the question of what exactly I want: I have to see the diversity in the paintings created as per artist’s gender. First, I filtered the data-set on Male and Female. But due to large number of overlapping points , the stacked bar chart wasn’t the perfect fit. So, I decided to go with only one gender. Due to uncontinuity in the year column, the geom_line wasn’t the perfect fit, so decided to go with geom_col</p>
</div>
