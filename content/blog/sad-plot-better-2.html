<h3>2. Description of the TYPE of graph</h3>
<p>This type of graph is a Marimekko chart</p>
</div>
<div id="description-of-the-data-you-used" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Description of the DATA you used</h3>
<p>The data is gathered from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/80-cereals/data">Kaggle Dataset</a>.It gives the nutrient information(such as calories,fat,protein etc.) for all the cereals across selected 7 brands.The quantitative varaibles such as calories,fat,protien etc are stored in individual column. The quantitative varaibles are name,manufacture name,type of cereal i.e hot/cold in individual columns.</p>

<h3>3. Representation Description: WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SHOW! Tell us about the graph, what it shows, how it can be used, definitions of different graph parts, etc.</h3>
<p>The chart shows the distribution of the selected nutrients information such as calories and nutrient breakup across different manufacturer.</p>

<h3>4. How to read it &amp; What to look for: How should a newbie to this graph approach interpreting it? What are the major highlights of the graph type?</h3>
<p>For a newbie, he should make a rough observation about the number of products available across different manufacturer looking at the width and get a glance of nutrient distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Major Highlights of the graph type</strong></p>
<p>After observation,it seems like product N offers more protein as compared to other products such as P,Q. Also, the width of the columns indicate the no. of products available such as manufacturer K has lot of products in the data set.</p>

<h3>5. Presentation tips: address how annotation is/can be used, how color is/can be used, and how the general composition is arranged (how are things arranged, scale, etc.)</h3>
<p>Annotation can be used to represent the relative % such that the % distribution also takes into consideration the width variable.The color can be improved using categorical color scheme since the chart is with default color scheme</p>

<h3>6. Variations and alternatives: are there common variations of this graph? How are they different, how are they used? Are there alternatives?</h3>
<p>The common variations of this chart can be Treemap,Radial column chart which displays breakup of individual categorical variables and the same time allows to compare individual breakups with others.</p>

<h3>7. How I created it: Methods section. How did you go about making this specific graph?</h3>
<p>The dataset is in the untidy form which was tidied such that all the nutrient measurables are stored in <code>nutr_stat</code> column using <code>tidyr</code> package.After tidying the dataset,I began to evaluate different quantitative variables and how can I analyze them.Then,I listed the possible graphs available aligned with the chart I wanted.Earlier, I used stacked bar chart but it was not able to encode <code>nutr_stats</code> column for y aesthetic. Then I settled for Marimekko chart.</p>
